/// "Remove from watch history", "Not interested", "Don't recommend

/// here tells one from another (#105, #106).

    /// carries no wording of its own and the actions are indistinguishable
    /// in it, so the screen that opened the menu names the outcome: a feed
    /// that ranks by taste was retuned, anywhere else the video just went
    /// away. Both strings are YouTube's own, lifted from the official app
    /// in all 13 languages rather than translated here.
